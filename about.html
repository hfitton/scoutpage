		<p id='keatext'>The Group</p>
	<p>The Group meet at the Scout Hall, Russell Reserve, Ngaio Road, Waikanae. This hall has been our base since 1957. Scouts have been in Waikanae since 1918 at various other locations.</p>

<p>The Group consists of a Group Leader, a Committee (who oversee property, gear and finances) and the Section Leaders who run the youth groups. We are constantly looking for adult leaders and committee members. All leaders and committee members are unpaid volunteers. The children of leaders pay no fees, committee members’ children pay half fees.</p>	
<h4>Membership fees</h4>

<p>Membership fees are $63 per term and are payable at the start of each term. <br>
A portion of the fees goes to National and Zone bodies. The balance goes towards payment of rates, power, insurance, adult uniforms, equipment, training and all running costs. We make up the annual shortfall in costs by fundraising and grants. Family support with fundraising is vital.</p>

<p>The Group scarf and woggle are provided by the group and are presented on investiture. The uniform shirt must be purchased by the member. <a href ="https://www.scoutingdirect.co.nz/">www.scoutingdirect.co.nz</a>  is the official scout shop.</p>

<h4>Consent form</h4>

<p>The <a href="form.php">consent form</a> must be signed by parents before youth members can take part in any Scouting Activities.  This gives the Group permission to undertake low risk activities within the normal programme. For all higher risk, overnight and weekend activities you will be given an individual consent form for each event which must be signed and returned before your child can participate. This form also covers consent to publish photos of members, so please note on the form if you do not wish your child to be photographed.</p>

<h4>Safety</h4>

<p>You must ensure that a Leader is at the Hall before dropping your child off. At least two adults (Warranted leaders/parent help) must be present for the sessions to run. It is important to come into the hall to collect your child. Suitable footwear must be worn to all meetings.</p>

<h4>Parent Help</h4>

<p>Parent help is required at all sessions.  A roster is posted in the Den at the beginning of each term for you to choose your nights.</p>

<h4>Punctuality/Absences</h4>

<p>Please ensure that children arrive on time and that you are on time to collect them. Please phone the leader if your child is going to be absent.</p>

<h4>Membership Application & <a href="form.php">Consent Form</a></h4>
 
<p>Please complete and return to the Section Leader.</p>

<h4>Payments </h4>
 
<p>Membership fees are $68 per term and are payable at the start of each term.<br> A one-off joining fee of $30.00 is payable to cover the cost of the scarf, book and badges provided upon investiture.</p>
<p>Fees may be paid directly to our bank account:  020591 0006032 00</p>
