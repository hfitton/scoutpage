			<p id='keatext'>Scouting - It&rsquo;s been going on every week, for more than a 100 years. Boys and girls, young men 				and women, all around the globe taking part in Scouts - the world&rsquo;s leading voluntary youth movement.</p>
			<p>Keas, Cubs and Scouts youth programmes are designed to educate youth and develop their emotional and community 				skills as they try new experiences.  This teaches the individual that they can succeed if they try, while at the 				same time developing the person into a citizen of New Zealand.<br>

			Each term is given a theme to provide the development, educational and fun aspects that are designed to instil 				confidence in learning to youth.</p>

			<h3>The Group</h3>
			<p>The Group meet at the Scout Hall, Russell Reserve, Ngaio Road, Waikanae. This hall has been our base since 1957. 				Scouts have been in Waikanae since 1918 at various other locations.</p>

			<p>The Group consists of a Group Leader, a Committee (who oversee property, gear and finances) and the Section 				Leaders who run the youth groups. We are constantly looking for adult leaders and committee members. All leaders and 				committee members are unpaid volunteers. The children of leaders pay no fees, committee members&rsquo; children pay 				half fees.</p>
