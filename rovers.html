		<p id='scouttext'>Being a Rover gives you access to a world of adventure, excitement and challenge...</p>
		

<p>Rovers Scouts offer a unique, challenging and rewarding experience for young adults in New Zealand.  Rovers get engaged with a balanced program of service, social and self-development which revolves around having fun in a big family-like environment.  As a Rover, you will get opportunities to develop a wide range of skills from leadership, event and project management to general life skills such as budgeting and self-reliance.  </p>

<p>You set your own pace to challenge yourself accordingly in a safe and supportive environment.  With the Rover Award scheme you can achieve set goals and be rewarded for your hard work.</p>

<p>Groups of Rovers are called “Crews”, each Crew runs itself with huge emphasis on developing a Crew identity and culture.  Teamwork is a key part of Rovers, so with all the opportunities Rovers can offer you will be able to hone your skills to assist with your future endeavours.</p>

<p>Rovers “Give back” to the community, either through Leadership roles, mentoring the younger age groups or service projects that benefit others.  There is no real limitation to the good you can do as a Rover - YOU can make the world a better place.</p>
